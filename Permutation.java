 * CSCI 5481 Final Project
 * 
 * This file contains the Permutation class.
 * It is used while forming the burrow-wheeler transform
 * to hold a single BWT matrix permutation.
 * The main purpose of this class is twofold:
 * 
 * 1. need to hold the sequence of the permutation
 * 2. need to hold on to the original index from before sequence is lexically sorted
 * 
 * This is bc java has no convenient way to get the indeces of a sort operation, as MATLAB does.
