chrX.fasta (EXCLUDED because of file size)
the X chromosome from SDSC genome (hg19 assembly)
used to extract sequence for conversion of bed->fasta

FMR1GeneAnnotationFile.bed
gene annotation file used to create simulated reads.

the rest of the files are simulated reads in .bed or .fasta
each .bed has a corresponding .fasta
the length of the simulated reads is at the end of the file name
These contain ALL reads and NM_002024 reads were taken from here.
